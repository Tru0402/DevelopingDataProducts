## Motor Trend MPG Appication
 
- We build an interactive model to estimate miles per gallon
- This is done using vehicle weight and number of vehicle cylinders
- The application is interactive and updates based on user's selected inputs
 
---
 
## Data used for Application
 
We build a regression model that estimates miles per gallon based on vehicle weight and vehicle cylinders
 
- Variable mpg is miles per gallon of vehicle
- Variable wt is weight of vehicle in thousands of pounds
- Variable cyl is the number of cylinders in vehicles engine

## Application is Based on This Model
 
```{r}
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl, data = mtcars)
```
 
---
 
## Here are the results of the model
 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
model.summary <- summary(model)
model.summary[4]
model.summary[8]
```
